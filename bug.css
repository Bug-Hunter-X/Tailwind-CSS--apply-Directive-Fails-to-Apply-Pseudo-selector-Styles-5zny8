This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles for the pseudo-selector. For instance:

```css
/* styles.css */
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```

This will apply the `bg-blue-500` class correctly, but the `hover:bg-blue-700` class won't be applied when hovering over the element. The element will remain blue without changing to a darker shade on hover.
